# SwipeLeftovers-backend

This idea was the collaborative result of four incredibly creative individuals who recognize that in this world today, there is a grave derth of love for all the lonely folk out there who struggle daily to find their soul mate, because all their swipes and likes have already found someone better. 

We here at Swipe Leftovers offer our condolences, and a solution- nay- a do-over at love. Give us a chance, and we'll help pair you up with someone equally as lonely and unfortunate as you. 

It's okay if you always come in seconds.. we know you're always second. But join us and become first seconds at Swipe Leftovers where you might find someone a little less out of your league 

(love not guaranteed; results may vary)

# MVP Goals
Create a fully functional CRUD MERN app that has user authentication that is deployed online with a Read.me file. Once a user is registered they can create a profile that includes information about them as well as their e-mail so that if they are interested they can connect that way.

# Stretch Goals
-Make it so that users can review their dates.
-Adding Google maps API to be able to see the distance between other users.
-Make the app mobile friendly.
-Create a chat feature within the app.
